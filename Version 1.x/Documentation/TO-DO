Completed Items

1.    Implement print utilities for the file manager.
2.    Determine roles of various options when browsing files.
3.    Page icons are not displayed. Why? Qt 4.6.3 resolves this issue.
4.    Implement an FTP browser.
5.    Ability to play MP3s and videos.
6.    Copy, paste, etc. icons.
7.    Copy, paste, etc. actions should be disabled/enabled accordingly.
8.    Must allow global font selection.
9.    Allow setting of page fonts.
10.   Search and URL widgets should notify listeners of copy events.
11.   Implement shortcuts in Full Screen Mode.
12.   Provide context menu for downloading files via the FTP browser.
13.   Improve the history menu.
14.   Pasting in the search and URL widgets should copy the contents
      from either the clipboard buffer or the widget's buffer.
15.   Disable copy and paste actions while browsing files and ftp sites.
16.   Some of the icons are not updated after the current theme is replaced.
17.   The FTP browser should provide a history.
18.   The history menu should have a maximum of 15 items. Once the limit is
      reached, old items should be replaced.
19.   Ctrl+W does not work when viewing the Desktop. This shortcut is intended
      to close QMdiSubWindow objects. Replaced with Ctrl+Shift+T.
20.   Inspect the busy cursor. Seems to be wild at times.
21.   Functional cookies!
22.   Implement a history browser.
23.   Improve the silly history.
24.   Shortcuts:
               CTRL + ENTER (.com complete)
               SHIFT + ENTER (.net complete)
               CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER (.org complete)
               ALT + ENTER (open in new tab)
25.   Close the current tab if the middle mouse button has been clicked.
26.   Allow user to close many tabs.
27.   The download list's Clear List button is not enabled under certain
      conditions.
28.   Allow URL selection via the up and down keys.
29    Must differentiate between a JavaScript request to open a new window and
      an HTML request.
30.   createWindow() must create a dialog-like window if instructed to do so.
31.   Implement advanced Web fonts.
32.   Provide an option for removing Dooble's WebpageIcons.db file.
33.   Prevent undesired JavaScript actions.
34.   Provide a cookie browser.
35.   Dooble must retrieve page icons on its own and pass an empty string to
      QWebSettings::setIconDatabasePath().
36.   Retain download information, if instructed to do so.
37.   Store cookies to permanent storage.
38.   Expand the file manager's columns. Add permissions, owner, etc.
39.   Prevent loadStarted() signal flooding. This problem is
      apparent when the user has initiated a load from beyond the
      contents of a page. That is, clicked links do not instigate this
      issue. Navigating from a page via a link will also create this
      problem.
40.   An option to automatically delete cookies every so often.
41.   Support for blocking cookie domains.
42.   Command-line options.
43.   Character encodings.
44.   The Tabs' actions' texts are not always correct.
45.   Implement the Vault. The Vault will provide users with the capability
      of total encryption of local data. Local data includes cookies,
      download information, and histories. As bookmarks become available,
      they too will be encrypted. GnuPG is the current choice of
      technology that will provide the encryption as it is available
      on a variety of systems
      (http://www.gnupg.org/download/supported_systems.en.html).
46.   The cookiesChangedForUrl() signal will sometimes result
      in the removal of good cookies.
47.   The URL widget's completer should default to a date order whenever the
      pulldown is clicked.
48.   Implement URL blocking. Look at QNetworkAccessManager::createRequest().
49.   Ability to view a frame's source.
50.   History sidebar.
51.   The file manager should allow copying and duplicating of directories
      and files. Hold down the Control key while dragging.
52.   Display source URLs of downloaded items (Downloads window).
53.   Implement popup blocker exceptions.
54.   Encode popup blocker exceptions.
55.   Flash causes intermittent crashes on Linux systems.
      QWebView was replaced by QGraphicsWebView for X11 systems.
56.   Plugin toolbar.
57.   Prevent HTTP redirection attempts.
58.   Provide means of selecting data sets for re-encoding:
      bookmarks, cookies, downloads, exceptions, history.
59.   Removing database items via URLs is nasty business. Perhaps
      object ids would be better. One way to avoid this is to encode
      the information correctly. This is not as easy as rocket science.
60.   Allow clearing of previously-selected tabs.
61.   Implement bookmarks.
62.   Rapid mouse clicks may trigger blocking of acceptable popups.
63.   The history implementation must consider HTML frames.
64.   Store history states to temporary (and encoded) files for quick
      startup after failure.
65.   Provide a list of tabs and windows that were left open during a crash.
      This option is only available for authenticated sessions.
66.   Restoration files need to be renamed whenever a tab is moved and/or
      becomes the child of a new window.
67.   Review uses of qobject_cast.
68.   Add-ons do not properly register actions with the Tabs menu.
69.   Clicking a link with the middle mouse button should open the link
      in a new tab.
70.   Display the date of download items.
71.   OS X (10.6.8) WebKit Qt 4.7.4, 4.8.0 issue:
              a. Visit http://wallbase.net.
              b. Click Login.
              c. Enter random credentials so that the login process fails.
              d. Press the Back button.
      Resolved with Qt 4.8.1.
72.   Double-clicking on known file types from the file browser should
      be well-defined. Perhaps a new option to define file types and
      Dooble's behavior regarding said file types.
73.   Replace QFtp with QNetworkAccessManager and QNetworkReply.
      Implemented custom dftp class instead.
74.   Highlight favorite sites in the Cookies window.
75.   Use the standard when retrieving a site's favicon.
      (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon#Standardisation)
76.   Some suffixes in the Applications panel are questionable. Allow
      the user to archive them? Context menu.
77.   dmisc::iconForUrl() and dmisc::saveIconForUrl() are demanding.
      Introduce strong hashes?
78.   If the Control key is depressed while a page initiates a load,
      a new tab will be created containing the new page.
79.   Create dcrypt. Migrate libgcrypt functions from dmisc into dcrypt.
      Remove temporary containers related to the re-encoding mechanism.
80.   Log libspoton errors.
81.   The clearing of the cache should be performed by a thread.
82.   X11 systems continue to suffer from Flash problems. It appears
      that the Adobe plugin is unstable. Also, the problems
      are version-dependent.
83.   Save pages in Base64.
84.   Spot-On integration.
85.   Add support for SSL errors.
86.   OS X (10.6.8) Qt 4.8.x issue:
      	 a. Enable Web plugins.
	 b. Browse the Web.
	 c. Unable to input text in the location widget. Closing
	    the current window is the only known solution.
      Unable to reproduce on other systems. The problem is caused
      by an unpleasant mixture of Qt and OS X WebKit libraries.
      Resolved in Qt 5.1.
87.   dooble::closeEvent() is damaged on Qt 5.0.1 and OS X. Resolved in
      Qt 5.1.
88.   The function gcry_strerror() is not thread-safe.
89.   Review SQL statements for SQL injections.
90.   QDataStream::write() failures are ignored in dcrypt.cc.
91.   A separate key should be used for keyed hashes.
92.   Store authentication information with encrypted data.
93.   Display SHA-1 hashes of downloaded files.
94.   Objects of type size_t may contain negative values.
95.   Review INI values. Extreme iteration count values will overflow
      the integer container.
96.   Pure privacy mode, including plugins. Plugins have been removed.
97.   Plugins must be identified. Signature files? Plugins have been
      removed.
98.   Use unique uuids to identify tabs for restoration purposes. The
      current implementation is flawed. Already implemented.

Remaining Items

1.    Provide a means for customizing the search engines.
2.    Syntax highlighting.
3.    Per-tab proxy settings.
4.    P2P e-mail.
5.    Cached items should only be available to owners of the items.
6.    Resolve persistent authentication-required prompts for proxies.
7.    Raise the window whose tabs have been modified prior to prompting the
      user.
8.    Raise parent windows of dialogs? Navigate to parent tabs?
9.    Provide a means of configuring a DNS proxy. The proxy
      shall only be used during the retrieval of a site's IP address.
10.   Configurable, site-based, HTTP headers.
11.   Implement as many items as possible from
      http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/Fingerprinting.
12.   The URL widget utilizes too much memory. Use the model-view
      concept.
13.   Review QWebSettings with respect to recommended fonts.
14.   Delayed downloads are not reflected.
15.   Allow regular expressions in blocked hosts.

Removed Items

1.   Changing to a temporary passphrase and returning to the original
     passphrase should allow some containers to be repopulated.
2.   Attempt to derive a class from QNetworkReply and complete
     dnetworkaccessmanager::slotFinished().
3.   X11 issue: after clicking a pulldown menu on a Web site, the
     menu's items may be shown at incorrect coordinates.
     This problem is caused by QGraphicsWebView. Unable to reproduce
     this problem when using KDE's default style on KDE.
4.   The GTK+ style distorts pulldown menus on X11 systems.
5.   QUrl::StripTrailingSlash is flawed in Qt 5.2.x. It's not flawed.
